## 💻 Project
PySearch is a project designed to demonstrate heuristic and uniform search algorithms through interactive simulations.

## 🚀 Solution

### 🗺️ Map Representation
- Generates an interactive grid-based map.
- Uses symbolic representations for various cell types (e.g., obstacles, start, goal, explored paths).

### 🤖 Minimax Algorithm
- Implements a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- Supports customizable board sizes and decision depths.

### 🔍 Heuristic Search Algorithms
- Uses Euclidean and Manhattan distances to explore paths.
- Provides real-time visualization of the search process.

## 🔥 Addressed Problems

### 🛤️ Pathfinding Challenges
- Finds optimal routes in a grid-based environment.
- Overcomes obstacles and navigates through various map configurations.

### 🧠 Decision Making in Games
- Implements Minimax for AI decision-making.
- Evaluates possible moves to maximize efficiency.

### ⚡ Optimized Search Strategies
- Demonstrates heuristic-based searches for faster problem-solving.
- Compares different heuristics to assess their efficiency.
